    <p>Welcome to my page.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>Hello my name is Dandy Alditya Nugraha, I was born in the city of Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia on July 25, 2001. I am now 23 years old. This is my second year at BYU-Hawaii and my major is Computer Science. I work in the Office of Honor as a Student Ambassador.</p>
    <p>I am the second of three children. My hobbies are traveling, watching movies/series, and playing basketball. I got my travel hobby from my parents who always took me to travel outside the city and even outside the country. 
        The countries I have visited are:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Malaysia.</li>
        <li>Singapore</li>
        <li>Hong Kong</li>
        <li>Philippine</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Quotes like this encourage me to push through challenges and <strong>keep</strong> working hard, knowing that the <em>effort</em> I put in will be <i>rewarding</i>. It's a reminder that the <i>difficult</i> path is often the most <strong>worthwhile.</strong></p>
