        <p>This is a photo of my vacation trip with my family visiting some beautiful places and countries with unforgettable memories and stories behind them. 
            <br>There was Bali which is the next island from where I live. The first temple I visited is HongKong Temple and also Disneyland which was fun. 
            <br>Singapore is a small clean country with cool destinations like universal studio and merlion statue. Cebu was the temple for my first endowment. 
            <br>Manila is where I went for MTC as a missionary.</p>
