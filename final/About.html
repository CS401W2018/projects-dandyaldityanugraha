        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The culture in Indonesia is that we must remove our footwear when we visit someone's home. 
            Based on our real-life experience as a full-time missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, this became a big problem that made us feel insecure about our performance. 
            After returning home from our full-time missionary service you build Shoesiety.
