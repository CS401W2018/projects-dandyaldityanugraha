    <h1>Engagement - OL, UL</h1>
    <p><strong> 1. What is the best way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects? </strong></p>
    <p> <blockquote>Doing by yourself, don't copy someone else work, and don't forget to upload it to github</blockquote></p>
    <p><strong> 2. When is your project due? </strong></p>
    <p> <blockquote> Monday, September 16 (11.59 pm) </blockquote></p>
    <p><strong> 3. What are special entity characters?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li> and &amp; </li>
            <li> less-than &lt;</li>
            <li> greater-than &gt;</li>
            <li> double quote &quot;</li>
            <li> single quote &apos;</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong> 5. What is the difference between OL and UL Tags? </strong></p>
    <p> <blockquote> <strong> OL: Ordered List</strong></blockquote></p>
    <p> <ol> 
        <li>like this</li>
        <li> and this</li>
        <li> and this </li> 
    </ol></p>
    <p> <blockquote> <strong> UL: Unordered List</strong></blockquote></p>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li> like this</li>
        <li> and this</li>
        <li> and this</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>In addition to my interests, I <em>often</em> find inspiration from quotes like this, as they <strong>motivate</strong> me to stay <i>focused</i> on my goals. It reminds me that consistency and perseverance are key to achieving anything in life.</p>

    <p>Remember, the &copy; symbol represents copyright, and you can also use special characters like &amp; to represent "and" in HTML code.</p>
