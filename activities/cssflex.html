            <li>What you learned about Flex and CSS.
                <p>What I learned is flex is tools to make layout in CSS. It's help to create a flexible and adjustable designs.
                    Also flex is simple and easy to ad space, managing, and add properties. In a easy way flex is help to control the positioning and alignment of elements.
                    <br>
                    Flex is particuarly useful to adjust space between and whitin items accoring to the size of the parent container.
                    This makes flex easier to design web pages that can look good across different screen sizes whithout worries about complex calculations for the positioning.

            <li>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?
                <p>Having accessible website means that all users can access it easly based on what their needs. Like opening website in the deskstop
                    and in the phone will have huge different from the size itself. It will affect all the layout and order if we dont have accessible website. 
                    It will consider not friendly for the user and make the user hard to access it. 
                    <br>
                    Especially for people that has disabilities or limitation it will help to access our website effectively. In United Stated there is a requirement, 
                    with legal standards to support those people. Accessibility is so important to also allowing with visual impairments, hearing difficulties, motor disabilities, or others.
