            <li>What you learned about Flex and CSS.
                <p>What I learned is flex is tools to make layout in CSS. It's help to create a flexible and adjustable designs.
                    Also flex is simple and easy to ad space, managing, and add properties.

            <li>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?
                <p>Having accessible website means that all users can access it easly based on what their needs. Like opening website in the deskstop
                    and in the phone will have huge different from the size itself. It will affect all the layout and order if we dont have accessible website. 
                    It will consider not friendly for the user and make the user hard to access it.
